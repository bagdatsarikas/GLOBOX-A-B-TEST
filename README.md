# 🚀 GLOBOX A/B Test — Food & Drink Banner 🚀

## Project Purpose  
GloBox, known for boutique fashion and decor, expanded into **Food & Drink**.  
We wanted to understand if adding a **mobile banner** could boost engagement and conversions for this new category.

---

## What We Did  
➡ Designed an A/B test on the **mobile site**  
➡  **Control Group (A):** No banner  
➡  **Test Group (B):** Food & Drink banner shown  
➡  Ran the test from **Jan 25 – Feb 6, 2023** with ~49,000 users  
➡  Measured **conversion rate, average spend, and spend per user**  
➡  Analyzed data with **SQL + Excel**, visualized findings in **Tableau**

---

## Key Results �
- **Conversion Rate**  
  - Control: 3.92%  
  - Test: 4.63%  
  - **+0.71 percentage points**, *p = 0.00011 → significant increase*  

- **Average Spend per User**  
  - Control: $3.37  
  - Test: $3.39  
  - **No significant difference (p = 0.94)**  

** 💡 Takeaway:** The banner **increased the number of users who converted**, but it **did not affect spending** once they converted.

---

## 💰 Outcome & Recommendation  
- **Accomplishment:** Proved that a **simple design change** can deliver measurable business impact.  
- **Business value:** Higher conversions at low implementation cost make the banner a strong candidate for rollout.  
- **Next step:** Extend testing window to confirm results across more time periods.
