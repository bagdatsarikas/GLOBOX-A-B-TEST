# ðŸš€ GLOBOX A/B Test â€” Food & Drink Banner ðŸš€

## Project Purpose  
GloBox, known for boutique fashion and decor, expanded into **Food & Drink**.  
We wanted to understand if adding a **mobile banner** could boost engagement and conversions for this new category.

---
## What We Did  
âž¤ Designed and ran an **A/B test** on the mobile site  
âž¤ Control Group (A): No banner | Test Group (B): Banner shown  
âž¤ Duration: Jan 25 â€“ Feb 6, 2023 (~49,000 users)  
âž¤ Metrics tracked: Conversion rate, Avg. spend, Spend per user  

### Tools & Analysis  
âž¤ **SQL:** Cleaned and aggregated raw user activity data  
âž¤ **Excel:** Performed hypothesis tests (z-test for proportions, t-test for averages) and built confidence intervals

## Key Results ï¿½
- **Conversion Rate**  
  - Control: 3.92%  
  - Test: 4.63%  
  - **+0.71 percentage points**, *p = 0.00011 â†’ significant increase*  

- **Average Spend per User**  
  - Control: $3.37  
  - Test: $3.39  
  - **No significant difference (p = 0.94)**  

** ðŸ’¡ Takeaway:** The banner **increased the number of users who converted**, but it **did not affect spending** once they converted.

---

## ðŸ’° Outcome & Recommendation  
- **Accomplishment:** Proved that a **simple design change** can deliver measurable business impact.  
- **Business value:** Higher conversions at low implementation cost make the banner a strong candidate for rollout.  
- **Next step:** Extend testing window to confirm results across more time periods.
