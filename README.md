PROJECT   BACKGROUND

GloBox, an e-commerce platform specializing in boutique fashion and decor, has recently expanded into the food and drink category. To increase awareness and engagement in this new category, the Growth team has initiated an A/B test, introducing a banner showcasing food and drink products on the mobile website.
A/B TEST SETUP

Data Collection: Purchasing activity data and personal data are collected for user and marketing research.  

Test duration: The A/B  testing was conducted from January 25th, 2023 , to February 6th 2023.

Test Groups:

Control Group 
Test Group

This group encountered the original, unchanged version of the GloBox mobile website.
There were no additional banners or prompts introduced to this version. It represents the ongoing standard experience users are familiar with.

Test Group users were exposed to a modified version of the GloBox mobile website.
The significant change was the addition of a banner focusing on the food and drink category.


Hypothesis  & Confidence interval:

Null Hypothesis
Alternative Hypothesis

The introduction of a food and drink banner on the GloBox mobile website will have no significant effect on user engagement, conversion rate, average spending, or overall revenue generation for the food and drink category.

Introducing a banner dedicated to the food and drink category on the GloBox mobile website will lead to a significant increase in:
* Conversion rate
* Average Spent
* Spent Per User


Metrics To Track: 

Conversion Rate
The percentage of users who, after seeing the banner (Test Group B), end up making a purchase from the food and drink category
Average Spent
By comparing the average spend of users exposed to the food and drink banner (Test Group B) with those not exposed (Control Group A), we can determine if the banner only encourages purchases.
Spent Per User
This metric provides insight into the buying behavior of individual users.


Statistical Significance Threshold: The level of statistical significance we will use (e.g., p-value threshold) typically, a threshold of 0.05 (5%).
